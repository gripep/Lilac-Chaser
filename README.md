What are you seeing in more dtail?
In the lilac chaser illusion, you see a series of lilac-colored blurry dots arranged in a circle around a focal point. 
As you stare at the focal point, you can observe a few different things.

Please try it out first (open the .svg file in a browser) and afterwards read the below:

At first, there will appear to be a space running around the circle of lilac discs. 
After about 10 to 20 seconds, you will then see a green disc moving around the circle instead of the space. 
With longer observation, the lilac discs will disappear altogether and you will only see the green disc moving around in a circle.
